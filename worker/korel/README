uws-korel - the KOREL worker based on UWS library


Requirements
============

- JRE 7 and compatible servlet engine (tomcat 7+ or glassfish 3+)

Korel executable requirements:
- amd64 kernel
- FORTRAN77 - package fort77 in debian

Post-process scripts requirements:
- gnuplot


Install guide
=============
for Debian 'squeeze' amd64 with tomcat 7 servlet engine

1.  install prerequisites
    
    required by KOREL
        apt-get install fort77
    required by post-processing scripts
        apt-get install gnuplot 

2.  install JRE 7

    download JRE
        http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html 
    pick a gz archive, for example jre-7u4-linux-x64.gz
    extract archive to /usr/lib/jvm/

3.  install apache tomcat 7 servlet engine

    download core tar.gz from http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi
    extract it for example to /usr/local/bin/
    set JRE for tomcat
    write JRE_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre1.7.0_04 to %TOMCAT_HOME%/bin/setenv.sh
    setup your access to tomcat manager
        add user with role manager-gui to %TOMCAT_HOME%/conf/tomcat-users.xml
    you can now start server using %TOMCAT_HOME%/bin/startup.sh
    you should be able to access your server at http://localhost:8080 
    and test manager at /manager

4.  deploy uws-korel using WAR 

    open http://localhost:8080/manager 
    select WAR file to upload uws-korel.war and deploy
    you can access uws-korel on http://localhost:8080/uws-korel

5. make post-processing scripts you want to use executable

    to enable all scripts chmod +x WEB-INF/scripts/*

6. configure uws-korel, edit file WEB-INF/uws-korel.conf

    set path to your KOREL binary to korel_bin, 
    and server address where worker is located
    to apply changes in config file, you have to reload application 
    or restart tomcat

application should be now able to successfully generate expected results,
you can test it using javascript client located on 
    http://localhost:8080/uws-korel
